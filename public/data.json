    "description": " This ancient lake plays an important role in the economy of Manipur.It is considered to be the lifeline for the people of Manip due to its importance in their socio-economic and cultural life, besides influencing the climate of the State. It serves as a source of water for hydropower generation, irrigation and drinking water supply. The lake is also a source of livelihood for the rural fisherman who lives in the surrounding areas and on phumdis. The traditional fishermen stay on these phumdis by constructing khangpok (huts). Considering the ecological status and its biodiversity values, the lake was initially designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention on March 23 1990.The Loktak lake and its precincts have faced serious problems due to loss of vegetal cover in the catchment area and construction of Ithai barrage at the outlet of the lake for multipurpose development of water resources. The degradation of the catchment area has led to the problems of siltation. The sediments deposit at the mouth of the rivers contributes to shallowing of the lake bottom. As the lake become shallower the level of the water also rises. Thousands of hectares of cultivable lands and grazing fields are submerged into the water. The domestic sewage from Imphal city carried by Nambul River is discharged into the lake affecting its water quality, thus leading to eutrophication. The size of the natural habitat of the brow antlered deer (sangai), which forms a part of the catchment area, has shrunk from its earlier 40 sq km to only 6 sq km now. Thus this species is under the verge of extinction."
